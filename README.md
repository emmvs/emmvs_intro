🍃 I also work as a Teaching Assistant at Le Wagon, where I learned how to code. 

Additionally, as a team of 5 Le Wagon alumni, we are currently building a quiz app for an NGO called Tech4Girls. In the app, students, who are part of the Tech4Girls Education Program, can practice their knowledge and coding skills. This happens as part of the Le Wagon for Good initiative.
