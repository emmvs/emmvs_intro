🍃 I also work as a Teacher & Teaching Assistant at Le Wagon, where I learned how to code. With a team of 5 Le Wagon alumnis, we are currently building a quizz app for a NGO called Tech4Girls where I work as a volunteer and Teacher. This happens as part of the Le Wagon for Good initiative. In the app students, who are part of the Tech4Girls Education Program, can practice their knowledge and coding skills.
